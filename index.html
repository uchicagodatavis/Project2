        <h3>What does it mean to find humanity through data? One could argue that data is dehumanizing in how it reduces groups of individuals to a series of numbers. How can data make or be made any more or less human when it is a system created and experienced exclusively by humans?

        <h3>The archive of the 533 executed death row inmates since 1982 provided by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice presents the viewer with an objective account of personal information about the inmate as well as the nature of their crimes. If one is to find remnants of the human identity of each inmate it is in the user’s own ‘file by file’ navigation of this archive. </h3> 

        <h3>It is with this project that we propose through making visualizations such as composite photographs, word clouds, and coordinate graphs that a narrative of what is human about this data can be constructed. This narrative may not always be about the individual but rather about what this group shares beyond their incarceration and sentencing. </h3>

        <h3>In searching for the shared human identity in this data what becomes most apparent is the loss of that very thing. Shared values begin to surface in the analysis of text from the final statements of inmates while personal histories are lost. The blurred faces of layered portraits contain information about gender and ethnicity but moreover are representative of the loss of identity through uniformity. Distinct facial expressions and identifying characteristics are lost to repetition in the photographs just as the weight of sentence structure and context is lost in the deconstruction and quantification of text.</h3>

        <h3>In representing the TDCJ data set through these alternative visualizations we can see what dehumanization through a system looks like. In contrast to the mode of that particular form the D3 map presents an interface that provides the user with an archive of the identifying elements of an inmate’s image and personal statement within a singular visual form. This specific form of access proposes that there is a way to make this data more humanizing while retaining the form of an archive. There are those in the world that may argue that these inmates do not deserve to be humanized. It is in the context of this project that I would argue that to humanize is not to elevate or to revere but rather to illustrate an aspect of human nature, even if this is an aspect of human nature that may be difficult or even painful to accept. It is in this choice to create such visualizations that we may find humanity in data.</h3>

        <h3>Each tab has a slightly different variation of a visualization showing the linguisitic closeness of each statement&mdash;the closer the dots are, the more similar the texts are. The Statements tab is simply the last statements. The Race tab shows the last statements color coded by the race reported in the data set. The Other Writings tab shows the last statements in comparison to other texts, such as poetry, sermons, and apologies. Roll over each dot to read the text.</h3>

        <h3> Please note that there are inconsistencies in the data and incomplete entries. </h3>
